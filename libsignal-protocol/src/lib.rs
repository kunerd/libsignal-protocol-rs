//! A Rust interface to the [libsignal-protocol-c] library.
//!
//! A ratcheting forward secrecy protocol that works in synchronous and
//! asynchronous messaging environments.
//!
//! # Key Concepts
//!
//! ## PreKeys
//!
//! This protocol uses a concept called "*PreKeys*". A PreKey is a
//! [`keys::PublicKey`] and an associated unique ID which are stored together by
//! a server. PreKeys can also be signed.
//!
//! At install time, clients generate a single signed PreKey, as well as a large
//! list of unsigned PreKeys, and transmit all of them to the server.
//!
//! ## Sessions
//!
//! The Signal Protocol is session-oriented. Clients establish a "session"
//! which is then used for all subsequent encrypt/decrypt operations. There is
//! no need to ever tear down a session once one has been established.
//!
//! Sessions are established in one of three ways:
//!
//! 1. [`PreKeyBundle`]. A client that wishes to send a message to a recipient
//!    can establish a session by retrieving a [`PreKeyBundle`] for that
//!    recipient from the server.
//! 2. [`PreKeySignalMessage`]s.  A client can receive a [`PreKeySignalMessage`]
//!    from a recipient and use it to establish a session.
//! 3. KeyExchangeMessages. Two clients can exchange KeyExchange messages to
//!    establish a session.
//!
//! ## State
//!
//! An established session encapsulates a lot of state between two clients. That
//! state is maintained in durable records which need to be kept for the life of
//! the session.
//!
//! State is kept in the following places:
//!
//! 1. Identity State. Clients will need to maintain the state of their own
//!    identity key pair, as well as identity keys received from other clients
//!    (saved in an [`IdentityKeyStore`]).
//! 1. PreKey State. Clients will need to maintain the state of their generated
//!    PreKeys in a [`PreKeyStore`].
//! 1. Signed PreKey States. Clients will need to maintain the state of their
//!    signed PreKeys using a [`SignedPreKeyStore`].
//! 1. Session State. Clients will need to maintain the state of the sessions
//!    they have established using a [`SessionStore`].
